# AutoFill DL OCR

This project automates the extraction of text from driver‚Äôs license images using **Google Cloud Vision OCR** and logs the parsed details into an **Excel file**.  
It also includes a **watcher script** that automatically detects new images dropped into a folder, processes them, and appends the results into the spreadsheet.

- Extracts **First Name, Last Name, DOB, Address, City, State, and Zip Code** from license images.
- Appends results to an **Excel sheet (`data.xlsx`)** with a `View Image` link.
- Supports **macOS** (tested), and also works on Linux/Windows.
- Auto-processes new files dropped into the target folder using a **file system watcher**.
